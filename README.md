# Sarthak Sidhant's Webpage.
This is My Personal-Website, A Portfolio for myself. Ah. Github, Best Way To Host Crap! Innit!?

-   I am a student studying science and web-development, other things too but I don't like 'em
-   I am not really a professional, and hate Professionalism, It Kills Humor.
-   I am only active on discord. My Discord is `Sarthak Sidhant#4374`
-   I love to troll people online. Whether it be a small wholesome joke, or a big racist joke.
-   I code in python and html, *nicely*, others, I try. just try.
-   I am a good brainstormer, and I will find an idea for you. make sure you do that before me.
