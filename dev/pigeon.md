Message to Pigeon

Dear Pigeon,

It has come to our attention that you have failed to uphold a promise made to us with regards to a hand-drawn pigeon photo that was to be used as your profile picture upon reaching 50 followers. We are deeply disappointed to learn that you have not kept your word.

We would like to remind you that making and breaking promises can have serious consequences. It can lead to the loss of trust, and in some cases, can result in legal action being taken against the offending party. As such, we strongly urge you to honor your commitment and proceed with the publication of the promised photo as soon as possible.

We would like to remind you that any further threats or intimidation, including muting us, will not be tolerated. We hope that you will take this matter seriously and take the necessary steps to rectify the situation.

Sincerely,

The Sid Committee
