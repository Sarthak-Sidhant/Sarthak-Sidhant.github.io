Hey Fellow Travellers!
I see you stumbling across my post, Since You Opened The Python Webpage, It’s Quite Obvious that I would be giving you a lecture on **Python.**

”Python is the best Programming Language”
Yep, That’s My Opinion because of the following things.

- It’s Simple
- It’s Not Lengthy Like Java (Life’s Too Short To Code in Java Man)
- It’s Beautiful, LOOK AT THOSE CURVY INDENTS!
- The Most Popular Programming Language 
(More Popularity = More People To Help)

In This Blog, We’ll Learn to Start Python, The ‘Sarthak’ Suggested Way!

### Step 0: Starting;

The First Thing To Probably Do is Installing Python.
And Probably The Best IDE in existence.

Follow the tutorial below:

[Get Started Tutorial for Python in Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial)

### Step 1: Learn The Basics;

You’re supposed to learn the basics & Try Talking in Python Language, Adopt It To Your Normal Conversational Method.

        ✅ Person 1: Hey! Whatsup Man!?

        Person 2: print(”Howdy”)

        Person 1: What?

        Person 2: print(”I am good”)

        Person 1: Are You Alright?

        Person 2: if alright = True: print(”I’m definitely Alright”)

                else: print(”not really”)

        Person 1: *Casually Leaves*

</aside>

You Gotta Understand How The Program Works. You Need To Create Algorithms And Experiment With it. You Need To Create Dynamic Functions That Request User For Input.
Many Apps Exist That Teach You About Python And It’s Basics.
However, I would only recommend some selective apps.
For A Paid App And A Great Experience, I Suggest Mimo.

[Mimo: The coding app you need to learn to code! Python, HTML, JavaScript](https://getmimo.com)

For A Free App, And A Mediocre Experience, I suggest Programiz And Sololearn.

### Step 2: Pledge A Project;

Want To Make This World A better place by Programming A Satellite?
Want To Make A Game in Just 7 Days? Or You are Interested in Sorting Data According To Your Needs? Want To Just Do Something?

[https://replit.com/@SarthakSidhant/charc#main.py](https://replit.com/@SarthakSidhant/charc#main.py)

For Real, Pledge Something.

Decide A Time Limit.
Explore Algorithms,         Create Things in Your Mind.

Enjoy And Learn At The Same Time

Do The Things You Find Easy, Since It’s The Best Way To Start.

The Projects Need Not Be Easy but Need To Have A Motive Behind Them

ATLEAST.

Encountering Problems?
You’ve Arrived At The Next Step!
Congrats!

### Step 3: Fail;

The Most Important Step is To Probably Fail, No Matter What Line You Experience Your Very First Error in. You Have Finally Entered The World Of Encountering Errors (You Probably Did it While Prepping in step 1 but i dont give an f) just hit me up (Sarthak Sidhant#4374 on Discord) or Actually Search The Error Up On StackOverflow Because That’s Where All of Us Find Help. If You want help from the best, Go To Python’s Discord Community, and Start A Forum There.
We Just help you all around, You just need to start asking.
Ask Us. We Guide You, We Don’t Write The Fricking Code For You.
Don’t Forget to Thank us ISTG.

### Step 4: Succeed;

Record your progress on [Github](me%20Python%20530ee169c7994ac2afef00bb026fb313.md) And Post Your Progress on Insta!
It’s All About Learning And Sharing.

Sharing is Caring, maybe you can inspire someone else.
or you can just mindlessly type shit like me (which im doing rn)

### ..Ending Off..

It was great to meet you. Thanks Alot.

I hope you actually implement some of these things.
and Succeed. It Would mean 1 more problem solver in our Community.
Me And The Whole Python Community Wish you All The Best For The Future.

And Welcome you to an unending universe of Creativity.

I am not really a heavily experienced developer, But If I am able to encourage someone to start coding, and developing, I will consider myself A Great Person.
